= 1.0.21 - 2025-11-28 =
- fix(customizer): Implemented direct `!important` color application for all H1-H6 headings in light mode within the Customizer's generated CSS. This ensures user-selected heading colors take absolute precedence over WordPress core presets and any other conflicting styles.

= 1.0.20 - 2025-11-28 =
- fix(customizer): Implemented critical `wp_head` hook for custom styles to guarantee precedence. Customizer-generated CSS is now injected directly into the `<head>` with priority 100, ensuring it loads after all enqueued stylesheets (including `global-theme-fixes.css`). This resolves persistent issues with text color overrides in light mode.

= 1.0.19 - 2025-11-28 =

- chore: Recompiled theme assets to apply updated SCSS defaults.

= 1.0.18 - 2025-11-28 =

= 1.0.16 - 2025-11-28 =

= 1.0.15 - 2025-11-28 =
- fix(layout): Forced light mode background for `html` and `body` to white (`var(--bg-0)`) using `!important` to prevent black background display.
