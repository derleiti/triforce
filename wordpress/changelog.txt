2025-10-05 (CSP & Security):

- Added a reporting endpoint for CSP violations at /csp-report.php, which logs to script.log.
- Added https://static.addtoany.com to the script-src directive in the CSP.
- Investigated 404 error for web-vitals.js and found that the file exists, but the server is not serving it correctly. Restarted Apache, but the issue persists, likely due to Cloudflare caching.
- Created unblock_helper.md to provide analysis and recommendations for script loading errors.
- Created known-bugs.txt to document known issues.
